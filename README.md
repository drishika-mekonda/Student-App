# Student-App
An Angular Standalone application allows users to view and add students using a reactive form with dynamic behavior. The Home page displays all students along with their class, gender, hobby, and favorite subject. The Add Student page includes required validations and uses *ngIf to show or hide fields and messages based on user selections.
